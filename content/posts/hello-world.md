Welcome to the site! This is a simple post to make sure everything renders correctly.

## A code block

Here's a small Go snippet, since Hugo is built with Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Hugo!")
}
```

## A list of reasons to use Hugo

- It's fast — builds thousands of pages in seconds.
- Single binary, no runtime dependencies.
- Markdown-first workflow.
- Built-in asset pipeline for CSS, JS, and images.

## A quote to wrap up

> The best tool is the one you actually understand.

That's it for the first post. More to come.
